## 📡 System Overview

An interactive, responsive portfolio website inspired by the iconic **Persona 3 UI (Atlus)**. This project transforms the original game's visual identity into a sleek **Cyber-Industrial** and **Cyber-Laboratory** environment, utilizing customized layouts, glassmorphism panel styles, and a bento-grid layout for clean content display.

The interface mimics retro game HUD aesthetics with stylized diagonal cuts, dynamic video backdrops, and active layout components.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern JavaScript/React stack focused on high-performance rendering and smooth state transitions:

*   **Client Framework:** [React 19](https://react.dev/) with [Vite 8](https://vite.dev/) as the build tool and bundler.
*   **Routing:** [React Router DOM v7](https://reactrouter.com/) for single-page application (SPA) routing.
*   **Styling & Design System:** Custom **Vanilla CSS3** using CSS Custom Properties (Variables) for themed colors, gradients, panel shadows, and glassmorphic layouts.
*   **Motion & Animations:** [Framer Motion v12](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for fluid page transitions, slide animations, and active state highlights.
*   **Server / Production Deployment:** Simple [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) backend wrapper to serve the compiled client-side code (`dist`) and handle client-side SPA routing fallback.

## 🔬 Core Customizations & Augmentations

This project is an advanced, personalized fork that customizes and extends the original template:

1.  **Aesthetic Shifts:** Transitioned the general theme to a "Cyber-Laboratory" using custom dark glass layouts and vibrant blue/teal colors.
2.  **Navigation Re-engineering:** Moved the Persona 3 navigation menu to the **lower-left** area of the screen to match classic user interface guidelines and improve visual balance.
3.  **Enhanced Side Projects:**
    *   Dynamically fetches the user's top repositories from the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
    *   Displays repo statistics (stars, forks, size) as custom styled data panels.
    *   Implements **full keyboard navigation** support (Arrow Up/Down to navigate, Escape/Backspace to go back, Enter to open the repository).
4.  **Social Links & Integrations:** Replaced placeholder channels with active professional and social networks (LinkedIn, Instagram) using custom hover-trigger cards.
5.  **Optimized UX Flow:** Replaced scroll-on-hover logic with deterministic clicks and key controls for cleaner, more intuitive interaction.
